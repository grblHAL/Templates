## Auxiliary output state

Adds changed aux port output states to real time report in the `AUX:` element.  
If a full status report is requested all ports are reported.
> [!NOTE]
> Only ports available via M62-M65 and M67-M68 are reported.  
The reported state is the logical state, not the actual output.
